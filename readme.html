#Certainly! Here's a step-by-step approach, 

including the `docker-compose.yaml` file, to set up a WordPress application using Docker:



Step 1: Create a new directory for your WordPress project:


mkdir wordpress_site
cd wordpress_site



Step 2: Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `wordpress_site` directory. Open a text editor and paste the following content into the file:



version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: your_mysql_root_password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: your_mysql_password
  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:80'
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: your_mysql_password
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
volumes:
  db_data:
  wordpress_data:


Replace `your_mysql_root_password` and `your_mysql_password` with your desired passwords for the MySQL database.



Step 3: Save the `docker-compose.yaml` file.



Step 4: Open a terminal or Command Prompt and navigate to the `wordpress_site` directory where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is located.



Step 5: Start the Docker containers using the following command:



docker-compose up -d


Step 6: Wait for the containers to start. Once they are up and running, you can access the WordPress site by opening your web browser and entering `localhost:8000`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the WordPress setup page.



That's it! You now have a running WordPress application using Docker. The database data and WordPress files will be stored in Docker volumes, providing persistence even if the containers are stopped or restarted.



Remember to replace `your_mysql_root_password` and `your_mysql_password` with your desired passwords in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
